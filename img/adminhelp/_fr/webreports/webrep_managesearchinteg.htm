		This <b>Manage Search Query Integration</b> page allows the search integration feature to be enabled and configured. It also provides a facility where the Administrator can manage all of the WebReports 
		that have been set with a data source of <b>Search Launch</b> on the system. When this feature has been enabled correctly, certain users will see a new button on the standard search launch screen. The following conditions determine the availability of this feature. 
		<ul>
		<li>The enable checkbox must be ticked, and a name for the search button filled in (A server restart must also be performed when the state is changed from 
		enabled to disabled or vice versa)</li>
		<li>One or more WebReports must have their data source set to <b>Search Launch</b></li> 
		<li>One or more of the WebReports listed on this page must be set to "Active"</li>  
		<li>For any user to see the search button (assuming the other conditions have been met), they must have at least See Contents permission to at least one of the
		active WebReports</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<P CLASS="body"><b>Technical notes</b>   
		Where multiple Content Servers are being used, the following points should be noted:
		<ul>
		<li>The enable option is server specific (stored in the Opentext.ini file) so this feature could be restricted to specific Content Servers. Conversely, if the same behavior
		is required for all servers in a cluster, the feature must be enabled (and the button text set) for all servers. This could also be achieved by copying the Opentext.ini
		file</li>
		<li>The activation/deactivation of individual WebReports is system-wide so any disabled WebReports will not be available on any Content Servers</li>
		<li>If this page is being viewed on a server where the feature is disabled, the list of active/inactive WebReports is not visible. To make this list available
		the Search Integration must be enabled,  a name provided for the button, and then Apply selected. As noted above, this will not actually activate the feature
		unless the server is subsequently restarted
		</li>
		</ul>
