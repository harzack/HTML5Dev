<h2 class="intro_message">Welcome to Prototype Window Class</h2>
<span class="intro_message">New version is out (0.95) </span><br><br>
<ul class="intro_message">
  Now you can set windows or dialog contents with an Ajax request!! This popup is created using an Ajax request. The dialog can even compute its width or height. Here is the line to open this popup:<br><br>
</ul>
<xmp class="intro">Dialog.alert({url: "info_panel.html", options: {method: 'get'}},  
             {windowParameters: {className: "alphacube", width:500}, 
              okLabel: "Close"});</xmp>
              <br/>
  <ul class="intro_message">
  This is really cool, you do not have to write HTML inside your page anymore. If you are writing a <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com" target="_blank">Rails</a> application for example, just write window content in a partial. <br><br>This release includes also:<br>
  - fixed IE issue when you destroy window with an url that embeds mp3<br>
  - fixed buttonClass issue for Dialog, so now yuo can custom ok and cancel button.<br>
  - update samples<br>
<h3 class="intro_message">If it's not your first visit, and if you have any troubles with samples, clear your cache.</h3>
<h4 class="intro_message">PS A rails plugins should be available soon!! (thanks to DJTal and Ricp)</h4>
</ul>
