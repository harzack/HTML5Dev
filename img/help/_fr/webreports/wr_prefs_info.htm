It is possible to reference settings from the <b>opentext.ini</b> file with a WebReport, using the standard constant tag syntax. This feature is subject
to the following limitations:
<ul>
<li>Only items contained under the <b>[WebReports]</b> section of the opentext.ini file can be referenced</li>
<li>Some standard options cannot be referenced. This is a development decision based on potential security issues. If in doubt, try to reference
a particular setting as defined below. If the setting has been blocked and undefined constant error message will be displayed </li>
<li>If a constant has been defined for a WebReport with the same name as a preference, the constant takes precedence</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="body">
The most common application of this feature is to define unique preferences that will only be used with this feature, i.e. preferences that do not
already exist in the [WebReports] section. This allows a system (server) level setting that can be referenced by all WebReports. Because the
opentext.ini file can vary from server to server, this feature also allows that WebReports can use logic based on a particular server. Here are a
few examples of how this feature may be used:
<ul>
<li>Define system level messages, titles or labels</li>
<li>Define file paths or URLs. This is effectively creating a globally (system wide) available constant</li>
<li>Define parameters that identify a particular Livelink server. For example, "SERVERTYPE=SECURE". In this way logic can
be added to WebReports to control their behavior according to which Livelink server they are being run from.</li>
</ul>
</p>

For more information on using the constant tag syntax see the section called <b>Referencing Constants in the WebReport Reportview</b> in the <A HREF="wr_constant_procedures.htm">Using Constants</A> help page.
