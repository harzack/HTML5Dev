WebReports supports several types of data source.  These data sources provide a WebReport with data when it runs.  As an example, a Livelink search
can be used.  When the given WebReport runs, it executes the search query associated with it then uses these results to provide the underlying data that the reportview processes
in order to create the output seen by the end user.
<br><br>
To configure the data source for a WebReport, choose <SPAN class="gui">Properties</SPAN> and <SPAN class="gui">Source</SPAN> from the
function menu. The following table summarizes the datasources that are currently available. 


<br><br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5">
	<tr class="body" bgcolor="lightgray" >
		<td align=center NOWRAP><B>Data Source Type</B></td>
		<td align=center><B>Description</B></td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="body">
		<td NOWRAP>&nbsp;Livelink Query</td>
		<td>This is used for any of the Livelink objects which provide data from either SQL or search index queries. The most common
examples of this are LiveReports, Saved Queries, Form Templates and WebForms. The only configuration required is to browse for the source object to be used</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="body">
		<td NOWRAP>&nbsp;Livelink File</td>
		<td>This allows files within Livelink that have HTML tables or delimited data to be used as data sources. It provides some
configuration parameters to allow correct interpretation of the data file. These are:
			<ul type="disc">
			<li><b>Static File Location</b> - This allows the user to browse for a document in Livelink that will be used as the data source</li>
			<li><b>File Type</b> - This parameter allows the user to select which file type is being used as a data source. Currently the two choices are:
			Separated Values (CSV, tab delimited etc.); and HTML Table
			</li>
 			<li>
			<b>Content Type</b> - This parameter is only visible when the <b>Separated Values</b> file type has been selected. It allows the parsing of the data source to be optimized
			according to the content of the file. For example, most delimited formats such as CSV need some way to allow the delimiter to be stored in the data without confusing
			the parsing software. In the example of CSV, products like Microsoft Excel use quotes to enclose any data cells which have commas in them.
            If it is known that a given file has no delimited cells with quotes then select the <b>No Cells Are Quoted</b> optionwhich has the fastest performance.
            If it is known that a given file has all cells quoted, the <b>All Cells Are Quoted</b> option should be used. The <b>Some Cells Are Quoted</b> option
            is the most robust option to use (and is the best selection for Excel exports).  It should be noted this option is slower than the first two options.
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Assume Strict Syntax</b> - This parameter allows the user to specify whether the data source has a strict and predictable syntax.
            For example, in a commma separated value file, the comma in between each cell will not normally be preceded or succeeded by any spaces. If this is known
            to be the case, this option should be checked. For separated value file types (e.g. CSV) this option is only available for
            <b>All Cells Are Quoted</b> and <b>Some Cells Are Quoted</b>.
            With HTML files, strict syntax specifies that all table/row/cell tags will be formed without any attributes and without any spaces.
            For example: &lt;TABLE&gt;, &lt;TR&gt;, &lt;TD&gt;. Regardless of which file type has been selected, this option should not be used where syntax
            is unpredictable or unknown.
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Column Separator</b> - This parameter is only visible when the <b>Separated Values</b> file type has been selected. It is used to specify which character
			will separate each cell of data. For CSV files this character is always a comma. For tab delimited files this character would
			be a tab. The tab link beside this field can be used to automatically insert a tab (<b>\t</b>)
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Row Separator</b> - This parameter is only visible when the <b>Separated Values</b> file type has been selected. It is used to specify which character
			will separate each row of data. For CSV files this character is always a carriage return (sometimes called end of line) or a
			combination of a carriage return and a linefeed.
			Different operating systems may use different variations of these characters. The links beside this field can be used to automatically insert
			characters that cannot be entered via the keyboard. The convention <b>\t</b> for tab, <b>\r</b> for carriage return/end of line and <b>\n</b> for
			new line/line feed is used
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Quote Character</b> - This parameter is only visible when the <b>Separated Values</b> file type has been selected. It is used to specify which character
			will quote cells. Cells are usually quoted when the cell data contains the character which is normally used to separate the data cells. For example,
			with CSV files, if the cell data includes a comma then the data is started and ended with a double quote (<b>"</b>). A double quote is the most likely
			character used for quoting but this parameter allows the ability to use an alternative character
			</li>
			<li>
			<b>Escape Quote Characters</b> - This parameter is only visible when the <b>Separated Values</b> file type has been selected. It is used to specify which
			characters represent a quote within a quoted cell. For example, in CSV files if a cell of data is quoted and a double quote is required within the quoted
			cell then the data quote will be represented as: <b>""</b>. Doubling a quote character is the most common way of escaping it but this parameter allows the
			ability to use alternative methods
			</li>
			<li><b>Column Headings Included</b> - This parameter is used for both <b>HTML Table</b> and <b>Separated Values</b>. It is selected when the first
			row in the data source includes the headings. When this is not selected, generic column names are used (Column1, column2 etc.)
			</li>
			</ul>

		The ftp server should provide access to a file in the correct format. Depending on the source

		The FTP File Transfer is performed in <b><i>Binary Mode</i></b> using a <b><i>Passive FTP Connection</i></b>.  
		Contact a system administrator to determine if this will require FTP Server and Firewall configuration.
