<p class="body">
To edit a reportview the <SPAN class="gui">Edit Reportview</SPAN> option can be selected from the
function menu <img src="../../images/functionsicon.gif" border=0 alt="Functions Icon"> for the WebReport in question.
This option brings up a reportview editor, described as follows:
</p>
<ul class="body">
  <li><SPAN class="gui">Action</SPAN> - <SPAN class="gui">Add Version</SPAN>, <SPAN class="gui">Add Version & Continue</SPAN>, <SPAN class="gui">Reset</SPAN> and <SPAN class="gui">Cancel</SPAN>
  buttons are provided at the top and bottom of this form.
  <SPAN class="gui">Add Version</SPAN> causes the revised information to be submitted to Livelink as a new version, and returns the user to the previous screen.
  <SPAN class="gui">Add Version & Continue</SPAN> also causes the revised information to be submitted to Livelink as a new version and then
  allows the user to continue to work on the reportview.
  The <SPAN class="gui">Reset</SPAN> button clears any
  changes made since the form was originally opened. <SPAN class="gui">Cancel</SPAN> simply dismisses the form without
  saving a new version.</li>
  <li><SPAN class="gui">Header Section</SPAN> - This section is used to provide any code that should be executed at the
  beginning of the WebReport. It is only output once regardless of how many report rows are being
  read from the underlying data source. Any opening tags like &ltTABLE&gt should be in this section; however,
  it is not necessary to include &ltHTML&gt or &ltBODY&gt if the standard Livelink header is being included.
  The Livelink header is included by default unless the [LL_WEBREPORT_EXCLUDEHEADER /] tag is used.</li>
  <li><SPAN class="gui">[LL_WEBREPORT_STARTROW /]</SPAN> - This line cannot be edited. It is only provided to show where the start
  row tag will be inserted so that users do not try to add another one. </li>
  <li><SPAN class="gui">Row Section</SPAN> - This section is used to define any code that should be applied to all
  data rows. Any tags that are used to refer to data source column data will only work in this section. It is important
  to note that anything in this section will be repeated for every row of the data source. For example,
  if there are 10 rows of report data to be returned, everything in this section will appear 10 times
  in the output of the WebReport. The only exception to this is if conditional tags are used to exclude
  some data from the output. (see the <a href="wr_tag_syntax.htm">Tag Syntax Guide</a>).</li>
  <li><SPAN class="gui">[LL_WEBREPORT_ENDROW /]</SPAN> - This line cannot be edited. It is only provided to show where the end
  row tag will be inserted so that users do not try to add another one. </li>
  <li><SPAN class="gui">Footer Section</SPAN> - This section is used to provide any code that should be executed at the
  end of the WebReport. It is only output once regardless of how many report rows are being
  read from the underlying data source. Any ending tags like &lt/TABLE&gt should be in this section.
  </li>
</ul>
