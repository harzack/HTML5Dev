<p class="body">
As with all Content Server items, WebReports have a Properties page accessible from the item's function menu. In addition to the standard Content Server tabs there are some
unique tabs which allow control over WebReport sources, destinations, constants and parameters. The basic features of these tabs and
the Specific tab are described here.
</p>

<p class="body">
<b><U>Specific</U></b><br><br>
The specific tab for a WebReport is similar to the specific tab for a document. Document properties such as Current Version, Max. Versions and
MIME Type are used to manage version control for the Reportview associated with the WebReport. In addition to these WebReports has the following unique fields:
<ul>
<li><P><SPAN class="gui">Run As</SPAN>.  This option allows the WebReport in question to execute as a specific user irrespective of who the person executing the report
is logged in as.  Because this capability can surface data the person running the report might not normally be able to see, the ability to change this field is
controlled by a privilege with <i>Usage Type</i> of <i>WebReports</i> and <i>Usage Name</i> of <i>Run As</i>.
</P></li>
<li><P><SPAN class="gui">Run/Export Audits Enabled</SPAN>. This option is unchecked by default and allows each WebReport to have additional audit events enabled
so that every RUN or EXPORT event will generate an entry in the AUDIT log.  Default behavior is unchecked owing to the volume of audits that can be generated if this
feature is used without careful consideration.</P></li>

<li><P><SPAN class="gui">Require Secure Token</SPAN>.  (Content Server 10 and above only) This option enforces that a WebReport cannot be run in a single URL. This is to 
allow protection against Cross Site Request Forgery. If parameters have been setup to prompt the user then the user will not notice any different behavior; however,
if this option has been checked and no prompting has been defined, then an extra prompt screen will be displayed to the user prior to execution of
the WebReport. This option is particularly recommended for WebReports that include action sub-tags. Note that this feature only applies to WebReports 
being run through HTTP requests. if a WebReport has this option enabled but is being run as a SubWebReport, there is no special behavior.
</P></li>

<li><P><SPAN class="gui">Oscript Scripting Enabled</SPAN>. This option will only appear when the Reportview
includes tags related to the Server Side Scripting feature. It is used to disable the execution of any scripts which may be defined and executed from the Reportview.
For more information on this feature see <a href="wr_server_scripting_info.htm">Server Side Scripting with WebReports</a>.</P></li>
</ul>
</p>
<DIV class="gui"><U>Constants</U></DIV>
<p class="body">
The Constants tab allows the creation and management of values that can be used in the Reportview (or other designated fields).
For more information on constants see <a href="wr_constant_procedures.htm">Using Constants</a>.
</p>

<DIV class="gui"><U>Destination</U></DIV>
<p class="body">
The Destination tab allows the developer to specify where a report is delivered to.  This could be email, workflow initiation, or several other destinations.  For
more information on destinations see <a href="wr_export_procedures.htm">Export Destinations</a>.
</p>

<DIV class="gui"><U>Parameters</U></DIV>
<p class="body">
The Parameters tab allows the developer to define parameter behavior for the WebReport.  This is used to control things like the prompt order, the default value
and whether a parameter is mandatory or not.  For more details on parameters see <a href="wr_parameter_procedures.htm">Using Parameters</a>.
</p>

<DIV class="gui"><U>Source</U></DIV>
<p class="body">
The source tab allows the developer to specify different types of data source and the format which the source data will appear in.
For more information on data sources see <a href="wr_changing_datasources.htm">Data Source Configuration</a>.
