The WebReports <b>Constants</b> feature provides the capability to pre-define data which can be inserted into the report output. This feature is typically
useful in the following situations:
<br>
<ul>
  <P><li>Where information in the WebReport might require changing periodically, a constant can be used to allow easy maintenance which can be performed by a
  	non-technical person.</li></P>
  <P><li>Where values must be manually defined (such as attribute numbers), constants make it easy to define and maintain these.</li></P>
  <P><li>Where the same reportview is to be used for multiple WebReports in different ways, each WebReport can have different constant settings.</li></P>
  <P><li>Where a reportview is being created with references which may vary between systems, constants allow system transparency to be managed.
  <BR>Note that the XML import/export feature attempts to translate any references to Content Server objects between systems.</li></P>
</ul>

<b><u>Global Constants</u></b>
<br><BR>
Global Constants are an extension  of standard constants and provide the ability to centrally manage constants for a particular collection of WebReports
that rely on the same data.  This is particularly useful where the user has a group of WebReports, Forms and other Content Server objects that are working
together to create an application.  Each WebReport can refer to a single Global Constant report defined at the top of its constants page.
<BR><BR>
The concept would be to have all WebReports for a particular application point to a single WebReport that is used to manage the constants for the entire
application.  The benefit of this is that once a constant is defined in your global report it is available to all WebReports that point to that WebReport.
This is a big time saver when you consider that a WebReports application may be built from 50 or more WebReports and other objects which all need to refer
to each other.
<BR><BR>
Global constants can be "daisy-chained" so that one WebReport points to another and so on.  Even so, global constants adhere to Content Server permissions, so if
a user does not have permission to see a given WebReport they will not be able to make use of the constants defined in it.
<BR><BR>
When working in the online editor, global constants appear with a star (*) next to them in the dropdown list.

<b><u>Server Specific Constants (INI Preferences)</u></b>
<BR><BR>
It is possible to reference preferences specified in the opentext.ini file using the standard constant syntax. This is subject to some limitations. 
For more information see the help section on <A HREF="wr_preferences_info.htm">Using INI Preferences</A>.
