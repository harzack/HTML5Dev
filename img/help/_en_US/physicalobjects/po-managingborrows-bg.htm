<P class="nr1"><A NAME="TMPID1659"></A>Once you have <A HREF="po-borrowphysitems-bg">borrowed</A> a physical item, you can return it, cancel the borrow, or pass the physical item to another user. You can perform all these functions on a single physical item or multiple physical items. </P>
<P CLASS="BRIDGEHEAD-SUBHEADING2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="TMP4REF25">Flagging Items for Pickup</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1662"></A>You can also flag for pick up any physical items you have borrowed or you can flag multiple physical items for pick up at one time. <I CLASS="EMPHASIS">Flag for Pickup</I> means that a user has borrowed the item and specified a return date for when the user is supposed to return the item. If the user is finished with the item sooner than the return date specified, he or she can mark the item as ready for pickup, which means it is ready to be returned. If the Records Manager has enabled the functionality, e-mails are sent to the specified e-mail addresses when items are flagged for pick up.</P>
<P CLASS="BRIDGEHEAD-SUBHEADING2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="TMP4REF26">Returning, Canceling, and Passing Physical Objects</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1665"></A>When returning one borrowed physical item, you can change the location where the physical item is stored, specify a comment about the return, set the date of the return, and select whether to return the physical item to its home location.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1666"></A>When returning, canceling, or passing the borrow of multiple physical items, you can specify the user who borrowed the physical items, the start and end date for the search, the location where the physical items are stored, the current location where the physical items are stored, and the unique IDs for specific physical items.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1667"></A>You can also assign locators to borrowed items that you are returning on the Borrowed Physical Items page. This option is only available when you select <B CLASS="GUILABEL">Return</B> or <B CLASS="GUILABEL">Cancel Borrow</B> in the <B CLASS="GUILABEL">Actions</B> drop-down list.</P>
<P CLASS="BRIDGEHEAD-SUBHEADING2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="EXTENDDUEDATE">Changing the Return Date for Borrowed Physical Items</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1672"></A>You can change the return due date for borrowed physical items by searching by the unique IDs of the borrowed object. You can narrow the search results by specifying criteria such as the user ID, original return date, or home and current location of the physical item.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1673"></A>You have two options for changing the return due date. You can specify a specific date that you want the return due date changed to, or you can extend the return date by a certain number of days. </P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1674"></A>When you change the return date, the process is captured in an item's audit trail. Any comment added during the process are also captured in the audit trail.</P>
<P CLASS="BRIDGEHEAD-SUBHEADING2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="TMP4REF27">Acknowledging Physical Objects</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1676"></A>To ensure responsibility for physical objects that are borrowed, Records Managers can enable the <I CLASS="EMPHASIS">acknowledge</I> functionality. When enabled, you are required to acknowledge that you have received an item when it is assigned or passed to you from the system or another user. When a you have a physical object assigned or passed to you, you will have five days to acknowledge that you have received it. If you fail to acknowledge that you have received the physical object, it will be sent back to the user who passed it. External users are also required to acknowledge a physical object when it is sent to them. Notifications to acknowledge a borrowed item will be sent through email.</P>
