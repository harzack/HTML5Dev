<P class="nr1"><A NAME="TMPID1550"></A>Search Forms are configurations of the Content Server Search page that you create and save. They allow you to reuse a particular configuration of the Search page without having to create it each time. For example, you can add the <B CLASS="guilabel">Created By</B> System Attribute to the Search page and save the changes as a Search Form. Each time you access the Content Server Search page using this form, the <B CLASS="guilabel">Created By</B> attribute appears by default. Personal Search Forms are not viewable by other Content Server users. Your Search Forms appear in <B CLASS="guilabel">Search Templates</B> on your <B CLASS="guilabel">Personal</B> menu on the Global Menu Bar.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1558"></A>Unlike a saved Query, in which all the search terms that you specified on the Content Server Search page when you constructed the Query are automatically preserved, a Search Form lets you preserve, with or without specified search terms, a framework of search criteria. For example, you can create a Search Form that is configured to search only the metadata in the Enterprise <I CLASS="emphasis">slice</I>. The Enterprise slice is a portion of an index that your administrator defines and which you can search. When you use that Form, all you need to specify are the specific Query terms themselves; the relevant search components are already configured in the Form. If, on a version of Content Server 10.0, Update 7 or earlier, you included theme criteria on a Search page, and saved your results as a Search Form, then the specified theme criteria will be available.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1563"></A>A Search Form also lets you specify display options for search results that are returned when you use that Form. For more information about display options, see <span><A HREF="sr-workingwsr.htm#SR-SETDISPOPTIONS">Setting Display Options</A></span> and <span><A HREF="sr-workingwsr.htm">Working with Search Results</A></span>.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="SR-UNDRSTNDSRCHTEMP">Understanding Form Types</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1568"></A>There are two types of Search Forms: system and personal. System Search Forms are created by the user who is logged in as Admin. Personal Search Forms are created by any user who is not logged in as Admin. The Content Server Advanced Search page displays the system Search Form by default, but you can configure the Content Server Advanced Search page to use instead, a personal Search Form that you create or edit. Personal Search Forms cannot be shared with other Content Server users.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="SR-CREATETEMPS">Creating Forms</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1574"></A>You create a Search Form by changing the configuration of an existing Search Form, and then saving the configuration with either a new name or the name of an existing Search Form. If you use a new name, the Search Form is added to your list of current Forms. Search Form names must be fewer than 80 characters in length. If you use the name of an existing Form, that Form is overwritten by the new configuration. Only users with administrator privileges, however, can overwrite a system Search Form. After you create a Search Form, you can modify it, specifying search criteria as necessary.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1575"></A>The number of Search Forms that you can create may be set by any user with administrator privileges. After you reach this limit, you must overwrite or delete an existing Form to add a new Form to your list. System Forms can be deleted only by users with administrator privileges. Regularly deleting Forms you no longer need helps ensure that the Forms you use most often are easily accessible.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1576"></A>As the creator of a Form, you can also perform other standard Content Server functions on it. For example, you can change its permissions, set notification, or access general or specific information about it. For more information about the operations that you can perform on Content Server items, see <span><XPROC NAME="ExtXrefStart" HREF="llesrt-h-ugd.ll-gen-items-bg" FMT="" NO1ST><A  HREF="../../../help/_en_US/root/ll-gen-items-bg.htm">Working with General Items</A><XPROC NAME="ExtXrefEnd" HREF="llesrt-h-ugd.ll-gen-items-bg" FMT=""></span>.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="SR-WORKTEMPSRCHRS">Working with Forms and the Search Results Page</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1582"></A>When you create a Search Form, in addition to configuring the elements that are displayed on the Content Server Search page, you can configure the default appearance of search results by clicking the <B CLASS="guilabel">Select Display Style</B> drop-down menu and selecting <B CLASS="guilabel">Edit the Display Options</B> on the Advanced Search and result pages. For more information on modifying display options, see <span><A HREF="sr-setdisp-bg.htm">Setting Display Options</A></span>. The appearance of the Search Results page is based on the settings you specify for each individual Search Form.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1587"></A>An administrator can make new attributes available for display on the Search Results page, and then save the configuration to the system Search Form. However, these new attributes will not be available on any personal Search Forms that have already been created. To make these new attributes available, you must recreate your personal Search Form by editing the configuration of the system Search Form and saving that configuration under a new name. For more information about attributes, see <span><XPROC NAME="ExtXrefStart" HREF="lleswat-h-ugd.catatt-overview-so" FMT="" NO1ST><A  HREF="../../../help/_en_US/webattribute/catatt-overview-so.htm">Working With Categories and Attributes</A><XPROC NAME="ExtXrefEnd" HREF="lleswat-h-ugd.catatt-overview-so" FMT=""></span>.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1589"></A>In addition to personal Search Forms, your administrator may have created system Search Forms. These forms are listed on the Search Form tab on the Content Server Search page in the <B CLASS="guilabel">Use this Search Form</B> drop-down list.</P>
