<P class="nr1"><A NAME="TMPID294"></A>Items in the Recycle Bin can be restored to any location within Content Server that the user has permissions to. By default, the location will be the one from which the object was deleted. Be aware, however, that if a folder that contains a document is deleted, and then an attempt is made to restore only the document, the default restoration location is blank. The location data and the item name can be overwritten. Be aware that moved objects do not inherit the permissions of the new location unless they have been moved into a volume (project, task list, channel, etc). After restoring an item, access rights may need to be manually altered. </P>

If two instances of a document called <TT CLASS="LITERAL">readme.txt</TT> that are stored in different locations on Content Server (e.g., one in a folder on the Enterprise Workspace and the other in the Personal Workspace) are deleted, the first document is moved to the Recycle Bin with the name <TT CLASS="LITERAL">readme.txt</TT> while the second document is renamed to include a numerical value (<TT CLASS="LITERAL">readme.txt 2</TT>). If you choose to restore a document that has an appended numerical value, it is restored with this new name. If you wish to restore the item with its original name, be certain to remove the appended numerical value in the <B CLASS="GUILABEL">Items</B> field.</P></TD></TR>
