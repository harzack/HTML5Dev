<P class="nr1"><A NAME="TMPID54"></A>Workflows are business processes that are defined in Workflow Maps. A  Workflow Map is a graphical representation of the business process. When you start, or <I CLASS="emphasis">initiate</I>, a Workflow, Content Server creates a working copy (or instance) of the  Workflow Map, which describes the business process and begins to execute it. The work that occurs during the execution of the business process is stored within a Workflow instance. Each time the same project or business process needs to be performed, you initiate another instance of the  Workflow Map. For more information about Workflow Maps, see <span><XPROC NAME="ExtXrefStart" HREF="lleswfp-h-ugd.wfp-main-bg" FMT="" NO1ST><A  HREF="../../../help/_en_US/webwfp/wfp-main-bg.htm">Introducing Workflows</A><XPROC NAME="ExtXrefEnd" HREF="lleswfp-h-ugd.wfp-main-bg" FMT=""></span>.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID61"></A>Workflows consist of a series of linked steps. Steps represent tasks, processes, or events in the Workflow, and the links that connect them define the processing path. Some Workflow steps may require participants to perform tasks, such as reviewing information, entering a comment, or attaching a document. These step tasks appear as Assignments to the users assigned to complete them. For example, if you are assigned a Workflow task, that task will appear on your <B CLASS="guilabel">My Assignments</B> page and the <B CLASS="guilabel">Assignments</B> tab of the <B CLASS="guilabel">My Workflows</B> page whenever the Workflow execution reaches the step. Other Workflow steps execute automatically, with no input from Content Server users.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="WF-PARTICIPATINGWORKFLOWS">Participating in Workflows</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID68"></A>If you are a Workflow participant, the Workflow step assigned to you appears on your <B CLASS="guilabel">My Assignments</B> page when the Workflow arrives at that step. For more information about performing Workflow assignments, see <span><A HREF="wf-perform-task-bg.htm">Performing Workflow Assignments</A></span>.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="WF-MANAGINGWORKFLOWS">Managing Workflows</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID73"></A>If you initiate a Workflow or are its manager, you monitor the progress of the Workflow or modify it on the <B CLASS="guilabel">My Workflows</B> page. For more information about monitoring or managing Workflows, see <span><A HREF="wf-manage-bg.htm">Managing Workflows</A></span> and <span><A HREF="wf-status-bg.htm">Monitoring Workflows and Assignments</A></span>.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="WF-COMPLETEWORKFLOWS">Completing Workflows</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID79"></A>When a Workflow is complete, the initiator and Workflow managers can archive or delete the Workflow instance, unless the  Workflow Map contains an automatic completion action.</P>
