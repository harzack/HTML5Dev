<P class="nr1"><A NAME="TMPID1861"></A>When Workflow processing reaches an email-enabled step, Content Server sends a notification message to  the users assigned to work on the step. In addition to notifying step assignees that the step is  ready for work to begin, the notification message provides instructions about how to complete the  task. Depending on the way the step assignment is defined, the message can contain  instructions about how to work with attachments, forms, and step comments. Content Server includes any Workflow attachments to the step assignment message as email attachments, and may include optional step features, such as permission to delegate the step or send the step for review.  For example, if a step is late or configured as high priority, the email message is sent with high priority.</P>

<P><A NAME="TMPID1873"></A>If you are assigned a step by email, you can review the assignment instructions, complete the assignment work, and then indicate that the work is complete by responding to the step assignment email message.  Although some email-enabled steps can be completed entirely through email, you have the option to work on the step in Content Server as you would a step that is not email-enabled. All step notification email messages include a link to the step page in Content Server, where you can view or work with the step. Also, email-enabled steps appear in  your <B CLASS="guilabel">My Assignments</B> page along with other assignments.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1877"></A>Some email-enabled steps cannot be completed through email. For example,  if a step requires you to provide Workflow attribute values or authentication,  it cannot be completed by email because Content Server does not support updating Workflow attributes  or authentication by email. If you are assigned to an email-enabled step that cannot be completed by email, you will receive a notification email when the step is ready,  but you must sign into Content Server to complete the assignment.</P>

Depending on the way the step is configured, the step may require only one person to accept and perform the work or it may instruct all members to complete the work. If the step is configured to use the first member accept feature, the first group member to accept the assignment by replying to the step notification message will then receive the step assignment in a separate email message. The other group members receive a message that indicates that the step assignment has been accepted. Also, if another group member attempts to accept the step action message after it is already assigned to another user, the group member receives an email error message explaining that the step is no longer available.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID1910"></A>If the step is assigned to a group and requires every member of the group to complete the step, the notification message is sent to all group members. Each group member must complete the step assignment before the step  can be completed.</P>
