<P class="before-ul nr1"><A NAME="TMPID532"></A>When Workflow processing reaches a step that is assigned to you or to a group to which you belong, it appears on your <B CLASS="guilabel">My Assignments</B> page and on the <B CLASS="guilabel">Assignments</B> tab on the <B CLASS="guilabel">My Workflows</B> page. You need to display the step on the <B CLASS="guilabel">Workflow Step</B> page to learn about the task you need to perform and then do one of the following:</P><A NAME="AEN545"></A>

<P><A NAME="TMPID544"></A>Also, if the Workflow author has email-enabled the Workflow, you may be able to complete a Workflow task through email. For more information about completing tasks through email, see <span><A HREF="wf-perform-task-bg.htm#WF-PERFORMEFASSIGNEMAIL">Performing Workflow Assignments by Email</A></span>. </P>

<P><A NAME="TMPID550"></A>Typically, a step assignment is described in the step's work package. The work package is composed of the instructions, files, comments and other information used in the Workflow, which appear on the Attachments, Attributes, Comments, and other windows on the <B CLASS="guilabel">Workflow Step</B> page. Also, completing the step assignment may often require you to modify or add information to the work package. For example, if a step assigned to you asks you to write a report, the <B CLASS="guilabel">Attachments</B> page of the work package may contain a word processing document that provides instructions on how to complete the report. The report you compile may be a spreadsheet that you must attach to the step so that other Workflow participants can access the information in the report. For more information about the work package, see <span><A HREF="wf-wp-bg.htm">Working with the Work Package</A></span>.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="WF-USINGDISPOSITIONS">Using Dispositions</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID556"></A>A Workflow step may require you to provide a disposition regarding the step, depending on the way the step is defined. Dispositions provide a way for you to quickly provide feedback about the step, and the value you specify may affect the way the Workflow is processed. For example, a step that contains a document for your review can contain Approve or Reject dispositions. If you click Approve, the Workflow continues to the next step, but if you click Reject, the Workflow could terminate or route the document back to the user who submitted it for further work. Dispositions appear as buttons on the step page and can vary in number and name.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="WF-COMPLETEGROUPTASKS">Completing Group Tasks</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID559"></A>A Workflow step can be assigned to a user or group. For example, a step that asks staff to verify an employee's vacation balance could be assigned to the Human Resources group. When the Workflow execution reaches the step, it appears as an Assignment for all members of the group. If you belong to the Human Resources group, you can accept or decline responsibility for completing the task. If you accept the Assignment, the step no longer appears as an Assignment for other group members, and you must complete the task.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID560"></A>If you belong to a group to which the task has been assigned with Full Expand or One Level Expand settings, Workflow participants can work on multiple step assignments at the same time. In these cases, the Workflow does not advance to the next step until all users in the group step have completed their tasks.</P>
<P CLASS="bridgehead-subheading2 BH2SEP"><A NAME="WF-PERFORMEFASSIGNEMAIL">Performing Workflow Assignments by Email</A></P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID563"></A>Content Server allows Workflow designers to email-enable Workflow steps.  When Workflow processing reaches an email-enabled step, Content Server sends a notification message to  the users assigned to work on the step, which includes instructions about how to complete the task. For more information, see <span><A HREF="wf-perform-bg.htm">Performing Workflow Assignments by Email</A></span>.</P>
