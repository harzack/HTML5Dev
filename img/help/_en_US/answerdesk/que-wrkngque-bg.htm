<P class="nr1"><A NAME="TMPID385"></A>If you want to change your question, and it has not received any replies yet (answers or comments), you can edit it. After you have received one or more replies, if you feel that the replies are not appropriate, or if you suspect that the question might be unclear in some way, you can clarify your question. Users can see this clarification when they browse the question, and users who have subscribed to the question are notified of the clarification in a question activity report. For more information about subscribing to questions, see <span><A HREF="que-subscque-bg.htm">Subscribing to Questions</A></span>.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID387"></A>Once you receive answers, you can accept or reject them. An accepted answer answers the question either partially or completely; a rejected answer does not. If you receive a comment that answers your question, you can also promote it to an accepted answer.</P>
<P><A NAME="TMPID388"></A>Once a question has one or more accepted answers, you can close it. This means that the content of the question, its clarifications, and its replies cannot be changed, and users who have subscribed to the question will no longer receive question activity reports for it.</P>
