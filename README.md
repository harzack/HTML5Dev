# HTML5Dev

In this repository, I play with little learning projects with HTML 5, Javascript and CSS.

- edocsnumberconvert: converts from eDOCS document numbers to repository file name back and forth
- add_number: adds 2 numbers in a form automatically
- showhideblock: uses check boxes to show or hide blocks of text in an html page

the "css" and "javascript" folders contains the respective code.
